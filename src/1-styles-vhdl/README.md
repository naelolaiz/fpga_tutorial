Example showing different coding styles of VHDL 

Four ways to apply the same binary logic, resulting in the same internal implementation:
 * [by defining the structure (instances of entities/components)](structural_example.vhd)
 * [by defining the data flow (with assingments)](dataflow_example.vhd)
 * [by defining the expected behavior (with processes and sequential definitions)](behavioral_example.vhd)
 * [by a circuit diagram (in this case, use as top-level construct)](diagram_example.bdf)
